----TODO

add a 'no lives' option - so you can hammer a loop without getting dead

allow loop over parts you can't play

add a 'start with a couple of notes' game

after playing a random notes / no-cache game, loading a normal game crashes as filename ends with .mid_no_cache = maybe set a flag...

options
    - audio connections

midi file options
    - adjust key signature
    - allow selection of midi track to use as right/left hand

check midi system after cable plugged in = midi_out doesn't get setup

solo pitch detect 

play song 

handle tied notes across bar lines (currently the full length is shown at the end of a bar, and at the end of a page - some extra bits of stave are shown)

read key signatures from midi files (currently just gets it from a csv file next to the midi file)

show progress bar when rebuilding level

allow lily dot to not load if library is missing

---DONE

new layout engine
    - include beaming

new score system - 
    no lives on bottom 
    count errors
    score = bpm / errors * speed

record score in a little file somewhere

put dots above played note - not the next note

build lilypond score one page at a time in a separate thread, start the level after the first page is generated - separte cache into 1 file per page

show a keyboard with fingers where you are and dots where they should be

implement key signatures

speed up score adding at eol

show 'new high score!' on new high score

redo the menu page - grid layout

visibl escape button in level

menu navigation with keyboard keys

options
    - midi connections
    - show helper keyboard
    - speed
    - midi file directory

check imports for existance and show errors for missing libraries


don't pass garbage into lilydots midifile name, infact, pass the whole midi file into the game, as opposed to generating levels - or something like that - stupid to duplicate fn&time_sig

no internal beepy synth - unless there is a nice library that doesn't hang and has no depends

jump back to begining of bar if you mess up

add a random order game
